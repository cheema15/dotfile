# dotfile
Welcome, Here are the cheema15 users dotfiles :)

## What to do:

To have the same dotfile configurations as the cheema15 user you will only need to do the following:

- First git clone this repo

- Now that you have cloned this repo run the following command (this command will run the install.sh file so that you have the same dotfiles configurations as the cheema15 user. If you do not want the same configs the do not run this command):

```
sudo bash install.sh
```

- Now you have the same configurations as the cheema15 User!
